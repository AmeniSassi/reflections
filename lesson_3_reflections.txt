When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I want to share my project with someone else hwo will collaborate with me and modify my project.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Pulling the changes manually allow us to be sure what changes and commits will be added to the original/local version.
