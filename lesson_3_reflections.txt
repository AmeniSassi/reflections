Pulling the changes manually allow us to be sure what changes and commits will be added to the original/local version.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
The benefit is that we can edit easily the files, especially when we are working on a complex project, and we can work offline using the last known state of the remote.
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Without using Git or GitHub, I would rather use the Google Drive to collaborate and share changes to a project. I think that using GitHub will be easier and more efficient.
When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
Using a seperate branch to make changes could help the traceability of a project. They differ in term of complexity.
